#cvitem("August 2023", "May 2024")[
  *Statistical Depths for Multivariate and Functional Data with Applications* _(MS Thesis)_\
  *Supervisor*: Dr. Anirvan Chakraborty, IISER Kolkata

  #set text(11pt)
  Studied the construction of numerous depth functions on finite-dimensional
  as well as function spaces, along with their properties.
  Examined applications in exploratory data analysis, testing, classification,
  clustering, and outlier detection tasks.
  Briefly focused on the concept of local depth, and used this to propose a
  new kernel based regression procedure.

#cvitem("May 2023", "July 2023")[
  *Combining in-host and inter-host viral infection dynamics*\
  *Supervisor*: Prof. James Watmough, University of New Brunswick

  #set text(11pt)
  Studied existing agent-based models for the spread of viral infections in a
  population, as well as ODE-based models for the dynamics of viral infections
  within a host.
  Developed a model which operates on both scales, generated and analysed
  simulation data.
  Attended the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Society of Applied and
  Industrial Mathematics (CAIMS 2023).

#cvitem("August 2022", "April 2023")[
  *Multi-Task Learning in Natural Language Processsing*\
  *Supervisor*: Dr. Kripabandhu Ghosh, IISER Kolkata

  #set text(11pt)
  Studied techniques for identifying, quantifying, and neutralizing bias in
  word embeddings, in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
  Worked on adapting a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model for this task.
]

#cvitem("May 2022", "July 2022")[
  *The Poincar√© Theorem for Fundamental Polygons*\
  *Supervisor*: Dr. Somnath Basu, IISER Kolkata

  #set text(11pt)
  Studied topics in algebraic topology.
  Explored tilings of the hyperbolic plane as covering spaces of genus 2 and
  above surfaces, and how this allows such manifolds to be realized as
  surfaces of constant negative curvature.
]

#cvitem("July 2021")[
  *The Stone-Weierstrass Theorem*\
  *Supervisor*: Dr. Somnath Basu, IISER Kolkata

  #set text(11pt)
  Studied topics in introductory group theory, analysis, and topology.
  Presented a generously illustrated proof of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem.

#cvitem("April 2020")[
  *Age stratified SIQR model for the COVID-19 pandemic*\
  *Supervisor*: Prof. Ranjit Kumar Upadhyay, IIT Dhanbad

  #set text(11pt)
  Studied the basic SIQR compartmental model in epidemiology, in the context
  of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.
  Modified this model by subdividing each compartment into age groups, with
  varying degrees of interaction amongst each other.
  Applied this model (using numerical simulations in python) to understand
  trends in infection rates/mortality in countries with different age
  structures in their population.
