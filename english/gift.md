# The Gift of India

Is there ought you need that my hands withhold,  
Rich gifts of ==raiment== or grain or gold?  
Lo! I have flung to the East and the West  
==Priceless treasures== torn from my breast,  
And yielded the sons of my ==stricken womb==  
To the ==drum-beats== of the duty, the sabers of doom.  
Gathered like ==pearls== in their alien graves  
Silent they sleep by the Persian waves,  
Scattered like shells on Egyptian sands,  
They lie with pale brows and brave, ==broken hands==,  
they are strewn like blossoms mown down by chance  
On the blood-brown meadows of ==Flanders== and France  
Can ye measure the grief of the tears I weep  
Or compass the woe of the watch I keep?  
Or the pride that thrills thro' my heart's despair  
And the hope that comforts the anguish of prayer?  
And the far sad glorious vision I see  
Of the torn ==red banners== of victory?  
when the terror and the tumult of hate shall cease  
And life be refashioned on anvils of peace,  
And your love shall offer memorial thanks  
To the comrades who fought on the ==dauntless== ranks,  
And you honour the deeds of the dauntless ones,  
Remember the blood of my martyred sons!

> Lo! I have flung to the East and the West  
> Priceless treasures torn from my breast

Mother India addresses the British who took away many things from India, including precious clothes, grain and gold. The most precious gifts were the Indian soldiers who fought and sacrificed their lives in different parts of the world. They fought bravely even without knowing the cause.

> Gathered like pearls in their alien graves  
> Silent they sleep by the Persian waves  
> Scattered like shells on Egyptian sands,  
> They lie with pale brows and brave, broken hands, 

The poet offers some brilliant images/similes to commemorate the sacrifices made by Indian soldiers during the World War. The soldiers were as valuable as pearls, buried in graves by the shores of Persia and the sands of Egypt. Their death is signified by pale brows and their bravery by broken hands.

> they are strewn like blossoms mown down by chance  
> On the blood-brown meadows of Flanders and France

The poet compares the dead soldiers with flowers that are cut down without any plan and remain scattered and uncared for. That is what happened to the Indian soldiers whose dead bodies were left unattended on the grassy fields of Belgium and France.

> Can ye measure the grief of the tears I weep  
> Or compass the woe of the watch I keep?  
> Or the pride that thrills thro' my heart's despair  
> And the hope that comforts the anguish of prayer?

Mother India asks the erstwhile rulers if they could ever measure the tears of her grief and know the extent of her woes at the death of her brave sons. She asks if they could ever know the extent of her pride over their bravery. Her heart seeks comfort in the anguish of her prayer.

Mother India gets a vague compensation by the depth of the pride she feels in the way the young men had sacrificed their lives for a noble purpose in war. She hopes that the memories of the soldiers will be everlasting and respected.

> Of the torn red banners of victory?  
> when the terror and the tumult of hate shall cease

Victory comes at the cost of the ultimate sacrifice - the life of a young soldier - which makes the banners of celebration red with the colour of blood. Mother India has a sad vision of these bloody flags proclaiming victory at the cost of her sons. Her soldiers died despite winning a decisive victory for their masters.

The end of terror and tumult, violence and conflict would bring in a reign of peace and prosperity. Life would be refashioned on the foundations of peace. Peace would become the equation of existence. The world would thank the Indian soldiers for their contribution and sacrifice for ushering in an era of peace.


The poet says that the day is not far when the violent commotion of war would come to an end. Life would be peaceful and normal again. The speaker is hopeful that the bravery of the Indian soldiers would be remembered with gratitude. The brave acts of the dead Indian soldiers would be acknowledged and honoured.
