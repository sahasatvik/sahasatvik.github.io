Salvatore, the hero of the story, was a ==young boy of fifteen== with a pleasant face, a laughing mouth and ==carefree eyes==. His father owned a little vineyard where he ==acted as a nursemaid== to his two younger brothers.

When he grew up, he fell madly in love with a pretty girl who lived on the ==Grand Marina==. She had ==eyes like forest pools== and held herself like "a daughter of the Caesars". They were engaged but could not marry until Salvatore had completed his ==military service==. As per this requirement, Salvatore left the island to become a ==sailor in the Navy== of King Victor Emmanuel. It was painful for him to be parted from the girl whom he loved so deeply. He ==wrote to her== long, ill spelt letters in which he told her how constantly he thought of her and how much he longed to be back home to see her.

Salvatore visited ==Spezzia, Venice, Bari and China==. In China, he developed some mysterious illness. He learnt that his disease was a form of ==rheumatism==. Due to this, he was rendered unfit for further service. The doctor told him that he would never again be quite well. He was ==rather happy== to learn this because he was now free to go home.

When Salvatore returned, he was welcomed home by his parents and brothers in the jetty. He was ==disappointed at not finding his beloved== there. In the evening, Salvatore went to the house of his beloved. He received a ==cold welcome== from her. She told him that they had heard about his illness along with news that he would never be quite well again. Salvatore's fianc√©e, nudged by her mother, ==told him quite bluntly== that she could not marry a man who would never be strong enough to work like a man. Salvatore returned home and wept in front of his mother. He was terribly unhappy, yet ==did not blame the girl==.

A few months later, on the advice of his mother, Salvatore married a girl named ==Assunta== who was older than him. With the little money that Assunta had, they ==bought a boat and a handsome vineyard==. They ==lived happily== and had children: two boys whom Salvatore loved very much. He ==worked very hard== all through the fishing season and occasionally in his vineyard. Often, his rheumatism prevented him from doing anything at all, prompting him to lie down about beach and take rest.

It was his ==innate goodness== that had enabled him to endure the hardships of life boldly and patiently.
