## Act I, Scene 1

*5 - 7:* The Boatswain tells the Mariners to take in the topsail and to pay attention to the Master's whistle. He also challenges the storm to blow as hard as it could.  
*15 - 16:* The Boatswain tells the noblemen that he shall be patient only when the storm subsides. The winds, thunder and waves do not care about the reputation and presence of a King.  
*18 - 25:* The Boatswain says that Gonzalo is a politician and is accustomed to giving orders. If he has the power to subside the storm, lightning, etc., and bring about calm weather at this time, it would not be necessary for the sailors to handle a single rope any further.  
*26 - 31:* Gonzalo says that the Boatswain has no signs to show that he will be drowned. His face and appearance show that he will die by hanging, not drowning. He also says that if Destiny prefers the Boatswain to die by hanging, then the inmates of the ship can be protected from drowning.  
*32 - 35:* The Boatswain tells the sailors to lower the topmast and keep the ship close to the wind with the main course.
