# The Darkling Thrush
*Thomas Hardy*

I leant upon a coppice gate  
      When Frost was spectre-grey,  
And Winter's dregs made desolate  
      The weakening eye of day.  
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky  
      Like strings of broken lyres,  
And all mankind that haunted nigh  
      Had sought their household fires.  

The land's sharp features seemed to be  
      The Century's corpse outleant,  
His crypt the cloudy canopy,  
      The wind his death-lament.  
The ancient pulse of germ and birth  
      Was shrunken hard and dry,  
And every spirit upon earth  
      Seemed fervourless as I.  

At once a voice arose among  
      The bleak twigs overhead  
In a full-hearted evensong  
      Of joy illimited;  
An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,  
      In blast-beruffled plume,  
Had chosen thus to fling his soul  
      Upon the growing gloom.  

So little cause for carolings  
      Of such ecstatic sound  
Was written on terrestrial things  
      Afar or nigh around,  
That I could think there trembled through  
      His happy good-night air  
Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew  
      And I was unaware.

		<dd> This implies that the century has drawn to a close. This poem was first published on the 29<sup>th</sup> of December, 1900, when the 19th century was coming to a close. The poet here imagines that he can see the dead body of the 19th century against the sharp features of the land where he stands. </dd>

		<dd> the clouds overhanging the land, regarded by the poet as the tomb of the dead Century </dd>
	<dt> His wind his death-lament </dt>
		<dd> the sounds being produced by the wind are regarded as a song of mourning </dd>
	<dt> ancient pulse of germ and birth </dt>
		<dd> the ancient rythm of copulation and reproduction; of sowing of seeds and the appearance of plants </dd>
	<dt> shrunken hard and dry </dt>
		<dd> diminished, stagnated, slowed down. All Nature seemed to be asleep. </dd>
	<dt> fervourless </dt>
		<dd> devoid of zest; without enthusiasm </dd>
	<dt> bleak twigs </dt>
		<dd> dull and leafless branches of trees </dd>
